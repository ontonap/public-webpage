You know how science collected lots of facts about the world. I focus my work on the facts related to the molecules produced by living organisms that could or will be drugs, or are used traditionally. To do so, I am developing laboratory (wet-lab) and software methods (computer lab) to capture, search, verify and share those facts.

- **Software Development, Knowledge and Data management**: Kotlin (JVM), Python, Spring Boot, Vue, Typescript, Ansible, Qemu/Libvirt,
  Ontologies, BFO, SPARQL, Information Retrieval Systems (Solr and ElasticSearch), SQL (mostly PostgreSQL)
- **Pharmacognosy and Natural product research** Tuberculosis and antibacterials, Antiparasites (schistosomiasis), Pain (and PAINS) management
- **Lab work**
  - *Analytical techniques* MS, NMR, (U)HPLC
  - *Metabolites from Plants, Bacterias and Fungi*
  - *Molecular Networking* (working on something beyond that)
- **Software and hardware development for research tools and toys** microcontrollers, 3d printing, laser cutting, CAD design (openSCAD, Blender), retrofitting, adaptations, reverse engineering , ç̡̛̱͉̥͎̝̳͇̲̲̼̟̞̬͐̅ͦͭ͛̀ͥh̡̙͓̦̪͍̲̺̲̔͗̔̐ͩ̈̅ͭͣ͘͢ą̜̦̜̝̞̬̬̗̦̳̠͕̠̻̗͌̔͋̐́ͧͤ̾͊̄͆̇͑̾ͬ̉ͨ́͘͠ơ̬̬̺͔͇͙̤̺̌͊ͭ̈͒ͥͪ͘͢s̸̵̛̝͚͎̹̤̻͚̱̲̺̥̜̮͇͓ͮͥ͛̊͌̋ͩ̈ͫ͜ͅ.̸ͥ̅̉ͣ̊̅ͮ̆̒̇̓ͭ͏͎̪̖͈̠̣̮̝̮̪̥͎̫̩̦ͅ
